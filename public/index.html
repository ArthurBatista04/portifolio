      content="Undergraduate computer scientist at the State University of MaringÃ¡ (UEM). Throughout the years as a graduate student I had the chance to work with 3 scientific projects: i) generic recommendation and monitoring systems that aid small and medium size websites; ii) studies regarding computer complexity theory focused on classroom assignment problem using combinatorial auctions; iii) evaluating lung segmentation impacts on automatic COVID-19 detection using convolutional neural networks.I also had the opportunity to tutor college students on logic and different programming languages. Aside from helping organize many editions of a regional tech event know as SECOMP (computer science week) at UEM.Although having a fair share of years spent at the university, I am currently working with web development at Eureka Labs. At Eureka, we focused on JavaScript frameworks such as React, Angular and NextJS alongside back-end servers namely being Express, Loop-back, Feathers and Java-Spring."

      Notice the use of %PUBLIC_URL% in the tags above.
      It will be replaced with the URL of the `public` folder during the build.
      Only files inside the `public` folder can be referenced from the HTML.

      Unlike "/favicon.ico" or "favicon.ico", "%PUBLIC_URL%/favicon.ico" will
      work correctly both with client-side routing and a non-root public URL.
      Learn how to configure a non-root public URL by running `npm run build`.
